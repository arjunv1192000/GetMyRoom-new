            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                21. The description of the Services and any Goods in our website does not constitute a contractual offer to sell the
                Services or Goods. When an Order has been submitted on the Website, we can reject it for any reason, although we
                will try to tell you the reason without delay.

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                22. The Order process is set out on the Website. Each step allows you to check and amend any errors before submitting
                the Order. It is your responsibility to check that you have used the ordering process correctly

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                23. A Contract will be formed for the Services ordered only when you receive an email from us confirming the Order (<strong>
                    Order Confirmation</strong>). You must ensure that the Order Confirmation is complete and accurate and inform us
                immediately of any errors. We are not responsible for any inaccuracies in the Order placed by you. By placing an
                Order you agree to us giving you confirmation of the Contract by means of an email with all information in it (ie the
                Order Confirmation). You will receive the Order Confirmation within a reasonable time after making the Contract, but
                in any event not later than the delivery of any Goods supplied under the Contract, and before performance begins of
                any of the Services.

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                24. Any quotation or estimate of Fees (as defined below) is valid for a maximum period of 30 days from its date, unless
                we expressly withdraw it at an earlier time.

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                25. No variation of the Contract, whether about description of the Services, Fees or otherwise, can be made after it has
                been entered into unless the variation is agreed by the Customer and the Supplier in writing.

            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                26. We intend that these Terms and Conditions apply only to a Contract entered into by you as a Consumer. If this is not
                the case, you must tell us, so that we can provide you with a different contract with terms which are more appropriate
                for you and which might, in some respects, be better for you, eg by giving you rights as a business.

            </p>

            <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-5">Fees and Payment</h1>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                27. The fees (Fees) for the Services, the price of any Goods (if not included in the Fees) and any additional delivery or
                other charges is that set out on the Website at the date we accept the Order or such other price as we may agree in
                writing. Prices for Services may be calculated on a fixed price or on a standard daily rate basis.

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                28. Fees and charges include VAT at the rate applicable at the time of the Order.

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                29. You must pay by submitting your credit or debit card details with your Order and we can take payment immediately
                or otherwise before delivery of the Services.

            </p>

            <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-5">Delivery</h1>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                30. We will deliver the Services, including any Goods, to the Delivery Location by the time or within the agreed period
                or, failing any agreement:

            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 mb-4 ">
                <li>In the case of Services, within a reasonable time; and</li>
                <li>In the case of Goods, without undue delay and, in any event, not more than 30 days after the day on which the
                    Contract is entered into.</li>
            </ol>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                31. In any case, regardless of events beyond our control, if we do not deliver the Services on time, you can require us to
                reduce the Fees or charges by an appropriate amount (including the right to receive a refund for anything already paid
                above the reduced amount). The amount of the reduction can, where appropriate, be up to the full amount of the Fees
                or charges.

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                32. In any case, regardless of events beyond our control, if we do not deliver the Goods on time, you can (in addition to
                any other remedies) treat the Contract at an end if:

            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 mb-4 ">
                <li>We have refused to deliver the Goods, or if delivery on time is essential taking into account all the relevant
                    circumstances at the time the Contract was made, or you said to us before the Contract was made that delivery on
                    time was essential; or</li>
                <li>After we have failed to deliver on time, you have specified a later period which is appropriate to the
                    circumstances and we have not delivered within that period.</li>
            </ol>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                33.  If you treat the Contract at an end, we will (in addition to other remedies) promptly return all payments made under
                the Contract.

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                34. If you were entitled to treat the Contract at an end, but do not do so, you are not prevented from cancelling the Order
                for any Goods or rejecting Goods that have been delivered and, if you do this, we will (in addition to other remedies)
                without delay return all payments made under the Contract for any such cancelled or rejected Goods. If the Goods
                have been delivered, you must return them to us or allow us to collect them from you and we will pay the costs of this.

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                35. If any Goods form a commercial unit (a unit is a commercial unit if division of the unit would materially impair the
                value of the goods or the character of the unit) you cannot cancel or reject the Order for some of those Goods without
                also cancelling or rejecting the Order for the rest of them.

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                36. We do not generally deliver to addresses outside England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and
                the Channels Islands. If, however, we accept an Order for delivery outside that area, you may need to pay import
                duties or other taxes, as we will not pay them.

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                37. You agree we may deliver the Goods in instalments if we suffer a shortage of stock or other genuine and fair reason,
                subject to the above provisions and provided you are not liable for extra charges.

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                38. If you or your nominee fail, through no fault of ours, to take delivery of the Services at the Delivery Location, we
                may charge the reasonable costs of storing and redelivering them.

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                39. The Goods will become your responsibility from the completion of delivery or Customer collection. You must, if
                reasonably practicable, examine the Goods before accepting them.

            </p>

            <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-5">Risk and Title</h1>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                40. Risk of damage to, or loss of, any Goods will pass to you when the Goods are delivered to you.

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                41. You do not own the Goods until we have received payment in full. If full payment is overdue or a step occurs towards
                your bankruptcy, we can choose, by notice to cancel any delivery and end any right to use the Goods still owned by
                you, in which case you must return them or allow us to collect them.

            </p>

            <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-5">Withdrawal and Cancellation</h1>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                42. You can withdraw the Order by telling us before the Contract is made, if you simply wish to change your mind and
                without giving us a reason, and without incurring any liability.

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                43. This is a distance contract (as defined below) which has the cancellation rights (Cancellation Rights) set out below.
                These Cancellation Rights, however, do not apply, to a contract for the following goods and services (with no others)

            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 mb-4 ">
                <li>Accommodation, transport of goods, vehicle rental services, catering or services related to leisure activities, if the
                    contract provides for a specific date or period of performance;</li>
                <li>Goods that are made to your specifications or are clearly personalised;</li>
                <li>Goods which are liable to deteriorate or expire rapidly.</li>

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                44. Subject as stated in these Terms and Conditions, you can cancel this contract within 14 days without giving any
                reason.

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                45.The cancellation period will expire after 14 days from the day on which you acquire, or a third party, other than the
                carrier, indicated by you, acquires physical possession of the last of the Goods. In a contract for the supply of services
                only (without goods), the cancellation period will expire 14 days from the day the Contract was entered into. In a
                contract for the supply of goods over time (ie subscriptions), the right to cancel will be 14 days after the first delivery.

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                46.To exercise the right to cancel, you must inform us of your decision to cancel this Contract by a clear statement
                setting out your decision (eg a letter sent by post or email). You can use the attached model cancellation form, but it is
                not obligatory. In any event, you must be able to show clear evidence of when the cancellation was made, so you may
                decide to use the model cancellation form.

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                47. You can also electronically fill in and submit the model cancellation form or any other clear statement of the
                Customer's decision to cancel the Contract on our website __________ . If you use this option, we will communicate
                to you an acknowledgement of receipt of such a cancellation in a Durable Medium (eg by email) without delay.

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                48. To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the
                right to cancel before the cancellation period has expired.

                51. Where a service is supplied (being part of the Service) before the end of the cancellation period in response to your
                express request to do so, you must pay an amount for the supply of the service for the period for which it is supplied,
                ending with the time when we are informed of your decision to cancel the Contract. This amount is in proportion to
                what has been supplied in comparison with the full coverage of the Contract. This amount is to be calculated on the
                basis of the total price agreed in the Contract or, if the total price were to be excessive, on the basis of the market
                value of the service that has been supplied, calculated by comparing prices for equivalent services supplied by other
                traders. You will bear no cost for supply of that service, in full or in part, in this cancellation period if that service is
                not supplied in response to such a request.

                Deduction for Goods Supplied

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                52. We may make a deduction from the reimbursement for loss in value of any Goods supplied, if the loss is the result of
                unnecessary handling by you (ie handling the Goods beyond what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics
                and functioning of the Goods: eg it goes beyond the sort of handling that might be reasonably allowed in a shop). This
                is because you are liable for that loss and, if that deduction is not made, you must pay us the amount of that loss.

            </ol>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                54. If we have offered to collect the Goods or if no Goods were supplied or to be supplied (ie it is a contract for the
                supply of services only), we will make the reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than 14 days after the
                day on which we are informed about your decision to cancel this Contract.

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-start ">
                55. We will make the reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you
                have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of the reimbursement.

                later than 14 days from the day on which you communicate to us your cancellation of this Contract. The deadline is
                met if you send back the Goods before the period of 14 days has expired. You agree that you will have to bear the cost
                of returning the Goods.
